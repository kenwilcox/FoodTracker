# FoodTracker
A simple food tracking application

In order to use this you will have to 

  - Get your own API Keys from [https://developer.nutritionix.com/](https://developer.nutritionix.com/)
  - Rename APIKeys.template.swift to APIKeys.swift
  - Replace AppId and AppKey with values received from nutritionix.com

You should be good to go after that
